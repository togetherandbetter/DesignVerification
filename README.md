# **Verification**

## **The first blog post, the opening of the text**  

This is a personal blog about channel coding technology that is used to sort out wireless communication knowledge, record research notes or make phased summaries. The blog content refers to, but is not limited to, IEEE standards and the like.  

This is a personal blog about integrated circuit verification. It is used to organize related ASIC verification knowledge such as SystemVerilog, UVM, etc., to organize, translate notes or make staged summaries. The blog content covers but is not limited to IEEE standards.  

This is a personal blog about Internet technologies such as AI, PCIe, MIPI, AMBA, and distributed, which is used to summarize technical knowledge about related languages, algorithms, data structures, and architecture.  

Each stage of the work has its own research tasks, and as the breadth and depth of research increases, so does the knowledge fragmentation. If it is not sorted out in time, it will be inevitable that it will be chaotic in the long run, which is not conducive to future work.  

Disclaimer: This article is for academic exchange only, not for commercial use. Therefore, the specific reference materials do not correspond in detail. If a certain part inadvertently violates everyone's interests, you can also look at Haihan and contact the blogger to delete it. This talent is shallow, and it is inevitable that mistakes will be made when sorting out the summary. I hope you will not correct me. Thank you.
